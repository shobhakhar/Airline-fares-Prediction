# Airline-fares-Prediction
• In today's world, Airlines implement dynamic pricing for their tickets and make their 
pricing decisions based on demand. Because each flight only has a limited number of 
seats to sell, such a complex method is used so that airlines can regulate the demand. 

• In the case where demand is expected to exceed capacity, the airline may increase 
prices to decrease the rate at which seats fill.

• On the other hand, a seat that goes unsold represents a loss of revenue, and selling 
that seat for any price above the service cost for a single passenger would have been a 
better approach.

# Purpose of the project:
●The purpose of this project is to predict how airline ticket prices change over time, extract the 
factors that influence these fluctuations, and describe how they're correlated.
